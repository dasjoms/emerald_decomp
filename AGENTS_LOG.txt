- Added `PLATFORM` make variable with PC option, enabling `-DPLATFORM_PC` and host toolchain selection for desktop builds.
- Created initial PC platform layer under `platform/pc` with entry point and stub modules for video, audio, input, timer, and filesystem.
- Implemented placeholder `PlatformInit`, `PlatformRunFrame`, and `PlatformShutdown` functions to orchestrate subsystem stubs.
- Extracted core game loop into new `GameLoop` function and added header declaration.
- Updated GBA `AgbMain` to call `GameLoop` and modified PC entry to run it each frame via `PlatformRunFrame`.
- Added lightweight GBA header shims under platform/pc and updated global.h to use them when building for PC.
- Created placeholder `map_groups.h` so `global.h` preprocesses successfully for the PC platform.
- Created abstraction hooks for hardware access: added platform functions for backdrop color, wait state, interrupt setup, and VBlank timing, and updated `src/main.c` to call them with PC stubs.
- Reordered `global.h` includes and expanded PC GBA shims to expose basic types, registers, and BIOS call declarations, resolving `u8` and other undefined identifier errors during PC builds.
- Introduced lightweight PC implementations of DMA/CPU helper macros and forward declarations so desktop compilers no longer warn about missing prototypes or pointer truncation when building core sources.
- Added C replacements for BIOS syscalls in `platform/pc/syscalls.c`, covering interrupt waits, memory operations, and LZ77 decompression; wired into the PC build to remove dependence on assembly stubs.
- Implemented SDL-backed input polling and 60 FPS timer, integrated SDL initialization/shutdown in the platform layer, added SDL2 build flags and DPAD constants, and adjusted strings header to coexist with system includes.
- Added an SDL-based video subsystem that opens a 240×160 window, manages an ARGB framebuffer, applies backdrop colors, and blits frames each iteration.
- Implemented SDL audio backend that feeds m4a’s PCM buffer to the host device, added `SOUND_INFO_PTR` shim, and wrapped hardware-specific portions of `m4a.c` for safe desktop builds.
- Included 'gba/types.h' in custom malloc header to prevent system <malloc.h> collisions during PC builds.
